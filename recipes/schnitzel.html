<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Schnitzel is a popular and delicious dish originating from Austria, but it has become widely popular across many European countries and beyond. The traditional schnitzel consists of a thin, boneless meat cutlet that is typically pounded flat to achieve a uniform thickness.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
    <li>1 cup self-rising cornmeal</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon pepper</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>3 eggs</li>
    <li>Â¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>4 (4 ounce) beef cube steaks</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice, or to taste (Optional)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a shallow bowl, stir together the flour, cornmeal, salt and pepper. In a separate shallow bowl, whisk together the milk and eggs using a fork.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. The oil should completely cover the bottom of the skillet. While the oil heats, dip cube steaks into the egg and milk, then dip into the flour mixture, and shake off the excess. Place in the hot skillet.</li>
    <li>Fry steaks on each side until golden brown, then reduce the heat to medium and cook until well done. Do not cover. Drizzle with lemon juice before serving.</li>
