<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Cedar Planked Salmon is a culinary delight that brings together the natural flavors of fresh salmon with the aromatic essence of cedar wood. The dish begins with a succulent salmon fillet, marinated to perfection with a blend of olive oil, lemon, herbs, and spices. What sets this preparation apart is the cooking method – the salmon is placed on a water-soaked cedar plank, creating a unique smoky flavor profile.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3 (12 inch) untreated cedar planks</li>
    <li>⅓ cup soy sauce</li>
    <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 ½ tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped green onions</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
    <li>2 (2 pound) salmon fillets, skin removed</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Soak cedar planks for at least 1 hour in warm water. Soak longer if you have time.</li>
    <li>Stir soy sauce, vegetable oil, rice vinegar, sesame oil, green onions, ginger, and garlic together in a shallow dish.</li>
    <li>Place salmon fillets in soy mixture and turn to coat. Cover and marinate for at least 15 minutes, or up to 1 hour refrigerated.</li>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat. Place planks on the grill grate. Heat planks until they start to smoke and crackle just a little.</li>
    <li>Remove salmon from marinade and place on planks; discard marinade.</li>
    <li>Close grill cover. Grill salmon until it flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes; salmon will continue to cook after you remove it from the grill.</li>
